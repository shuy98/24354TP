Term project for course 24-354 Gadgetry: Sensors, Actuators, and Processors at Carnegine Mellon University.  
This is a team project by Shu You, Nikhila Vembu, and Hardik Singh.

## Problem Statement
We are aiming to display and test how well we can control unmanned robots and drones better with our bodies. 
Where "gaming controllers" are limited by their buttons, we can move our body more precisely and in a greater variety of ways, giving us access to improved ways of controlling the robot.
